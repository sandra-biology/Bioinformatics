# Bioinformatics projects

- WGS (whole genome sequencing) project
    - I am using whole genome sequencing data I obtained from Parkinson's Progressive Marker Initiative study
    - my work with this project is similar to what I was doing as a Bioinformatics Analyst at Indiana University
    - for full details, see https://github.com/sandra-biology/Bioinformatics/blob/main/WGS/README.md

- SARS-CoV-2 project
    - this project is on virus which causes COVID-19
    - I am using viral sequences and coding sequences and sequence reads (parts of viral and coding sequences that are output of sequencers; reads are assembled into viral and coding sequences and genomes)
    - goal is to find sequence that led to the changes we saw with the spike protein

- Soybeans project
    - simple project based on the sequences I used in my thesis project
    - sequence used to start the project is added to the project folder at https://github.com/sandra-biology/Bioinformatics/Soybeans
    - I am using Nucleotide BLAST to perform the alignments and Python for all downstream analysis
    - goal is to find subsequences of genes in sequences producing significant alignments
