# Bioinformatics projects

- WGS (whole genome sequencing) project
    - I am using whole genome sequencing data I obtained from Parkinson's Progressive Marker Initiative study
    - my work with this project is similar to what I was doing as a Bioinformatics Analyst at Indiana University
- SARS-CoV-2 project
    - this project is on virus which causes COVID-19
    - I am using viral sequences and coding sequences and sequence reads (parts of viral and coding sequences that are output of sequencers; reads are assembled into viral and coding sequences and genomes)
    - goal is to find sequence that led to the changes we saw with the spike protein
