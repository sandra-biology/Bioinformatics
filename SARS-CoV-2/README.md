# COVID-19 project

This folder contains the work I am doing for my own project on COVID-19 data. For this project I am using SARS-CoV-2 viral and coding sequences, read data I obtained from the NCBI SRA Archive and COVID-19 Data Portal. https://github.com/sandra-biology/Bioinformatics/blob/main/SARS-CoV-2/input_sequence_info.txt has the accession numbers for the viral and coding sequences (I was using accession numbers as alignment input instead of uploading sequence files).

Project goal: find sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that led to the changes we observed in the spike protein as the new variants evolved.

This folder contains the following file types:
- Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file: this file contains project notes
- Text file with the information on the viral and coding sequences obtained from the COVID-19 Data Portal

Tools I am using:
- BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool): I am using the web version at this point
- Galaxy Software
